Skully, a robotics engineer working for SpaceZ, faces a heart-wrenching dilemma when his lover Sophia leaves for Planet Sanctuary, as Earth becomes uninhabitable. While working on a space station owned by the immortal Spectre Blackwell, Skully creates a robot, SIRS, for companionship. Unexpectedly, SIRS becomes a key to uncovering Blackwell's malevolent plans. Skully learns Blackwell is responsible for Earth's destruction and plans to exploit Sanctuary. A secret meeting, accidentally broadcasted via SIRS, reveals these sinister intentions. Determined to thwart Blackwell and save Sanctuary, Skully devises a bold plan to destroy the space station, scattering its wealth in space, with hopes of using it to reunite with Sophia on Sanctuary and start anew. Skully’s colleagues urge him to stay on the familiar, routine-bound space station, dismissing his dream of going to Planet Sanctuary as futile. Even his friends question his resolve, suggesting it’s not worth venturing to a foreign planet for someone he’s already lost. But Skully is undeterred; his longing goes beyond what’s comfortable and known. He feels an undeniable pull to explore uncharted realms, to forge connections across cultures, and to break free from the limitations around him. Reuniting with Sophia on Sanctuary isn’t just a mission of love; it’s a journey of discovery, one that holds the promise of a life filled with possibility and connection.
